				<h3>When I joined Life House we were strutured like in many Product organizations, with a VP of Product and a Product Director. </h3>
				<p>We were two designers delivering experiences for two squads, and my main mission, was to normalize the user interface to start building a Design System with a Lean approach.</p>
                <p>Rapidly after, and because of the economics in the world, we needed to change the way we were structured, so I turn into a solo designer with two Product Manager to handdle everything that was going on. We were both new in the company with a lot to learn in front of us.</p>

                <p>Revenue Dashboard; the challenge here was how to answer to the status of the Performance of your Property.</p>
                <p>Then we tackle the Marketing Dashboard; which needed to answer the Performance of the Marking initiatives that the company takes when Life House administrating a property, which is another service Life House offers to Property Owners.</p>

            	<h3>Enhancing the Pricing Calendar</h3>
                <p>As part of the offering, Life House have a Dynamic Pricing service associated to RMMS; this allows Property Owner or Revenue Managers, look at their upcoming pricing for the property and take actions with specific marketing metrics provided by Life House but considering many entry points; address, competitors, seasonality and special events in your area.</p>
                <p>This is a complex part of the product, because it holds a lot of information and it's difficult to take decisions without truly understanding it. So our goal, was to simplify as much as possible to make this happen with our financial stakeholders. (Keep in mind this type of user type)</p>

				<h2>Bringing cities to life with the Retail POS of Lightspeed</h2>
				
				<p><a href="https://www.lightspeedhq.com">Lightspeed</a> gave me the opportunity and ownership of their Retail Point of Sale for iOS, which gave me so much experience.</p>

                <p>I had the chance to meet and work with many internal stakeholders and multiple users types. I helped connecting them and making the biggest release of the product in many years. Which gave me an internal promotion to work together with the Sales team to re design their processes.</p>
