				<h3>When I joined Life House we were strutured like in many Product organizations, with a VP of Product, a Product Director. We were two designers delivering experiences for two squads, and my main mission, was to normalize the user interface to start building a Design System with a Lean approach.</h3>
                <p>Rapidly after, and because of the economics in the world, we needed to change the way we were structured; So suddenly I was a solo designer with in one Product Manager to handdle everything that was going on. We were both new in the company with a lot to learn in front of us.</p>

                <p>As part of the offering, Life House have a Dynamic Pricing service associated to RMMS; this allows Property Owner or Revenue Managers, look at their upcoming pricing for the property and take actions with specific marketing metrics provided by Life House but considering many entry points; address, competitors, seasonality and special events in your area.</p>
                <p>This is a complex part of the product, because it holds a lot of information and it's difficult to take decisions without truly understanding it. So our goal, was to simplify as much as possible to make this happen with our financial stakeholders. (Keep in mind this type of user type)</p>
