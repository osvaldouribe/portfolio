				<p>My career journey began in Los Angeles at <a href="https://designcodedeploy.com">Plural</a>, right after completing my Bachelor's in Graphic Design, while I was still based in Santiago de Chile. This early experience taught me the ropes of remote work and instilled a strong work ethic.</p>
				<p>Subsequently, I joined <a href="https://www.jelly.cl">Jelly digital</a>, an agency specializing in Public Relations, which greatly enhanced my communication skills. My role involved creating a wealth of content, especially for Google Plus, a platform from days gone by.</p>
				<p>The next chapter in my career led me to <a href="https://www.ilogica.cl">Ilogica</a>, where I was entrusted with building their design team and internal processes. This role was an absolute joy; we crafted numerous design systems and websites for a variety of companies.</p>

				<h2>Versatile Roles at Opslock</h2>

                <p>During my time at <a href="https://www.opslock.com">Opslock</a>, I took on various roles. I spearheaded the development of a comprehensive Design System, while also nurturing a Design Thinking culture within the organization. This endeavor was particularly rewarding, as it involved building a non-existent product that harnessed artificial intelligence to calculate real-time risk.</p>

				<p>In parallel, I facilitated discovery sessions to chart the current Customer Journey as part of our commitment to assisting customers in their digitalization processes.</p>
